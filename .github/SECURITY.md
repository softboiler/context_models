# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We only support the latest version, but we try to show `DeprecationWarning`s for awhile prior to breaking compatibility.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you have found a vulnerability, please use [GitHub's security advisory form](<https://github.com/softboiler/context_models/security/advisories/new>) or email Blake Naccarato, Kwang Jin Kim at <blake.naccarato@gmail.com>.
